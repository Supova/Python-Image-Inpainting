# Image Inpainting
REF: https://github.com/ayulockin/deepimageinpainting

In this work we employ convolutional neural network (CNN) based autoencoder-decoder model on CIFAR-10 dataset for image inpainting. We create masked images by producing random thick lines on the image to be used as training data. We test the model using a testing data set that was not used in training. We calculate the PSNR and SSIM metrics to quantify the performance of our model.
